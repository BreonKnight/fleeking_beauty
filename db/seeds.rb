# This file should contain all the record creation needed to seed the database with its default values.
# The data can then be loaded with the rake db:seed (or created alongside the db with db:setup).
#
# Examples:
# place = Place.create([
  # { name: 'Chicago' },
  # { lat: '41.8369' },
  # { lon: '87.6847' }
  # ])

Place.create([
  name: 'Chicago',
  lat: '41.8369',
  lon: '87.6847'
